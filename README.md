# Apply UX Principles to a Simple Interface Design

### UX issues
The home screen of the app displays a cluttered interface with overwhelming information, making it difficult for users to focus on their fitness goals. Additionally, the navigation structure lacks clarity, and the interaction design for tracking activities is not intuitive

### UX solutions
Simplify the home screen layout by reducing visual noise, decluttering unnecessary information, and focusing on the key fitness goals and progress.

> This would create a clearer and more motivating interface for users.

Enhance the visual hierarchy by prioritizing important elements such as the userâ€™s daily activity summary, goal progress, and personalized recommendations.

> This would help users quickly access the most relevant information.

Improve the interaction design by introducing clear and intuitive icons and buttons for tracking activities, such as running, cycling, or weightlifting.

> Providing real-time feedback during activity tracking, such as distance covered or calories burned, would further engage users.


Streamline the navigation by implementing a clear and intuitive menu structure, allowing users to easily access features like activity tracking, goal setting, and progress history.

> This would enhance the overall usability and ease of exploration within the app.

### Personal improves

The user must be able to navigate within the entire application without needing to flow knowledge through many unnecessary steps.

The least visual load for the user should be considered, since the more information the user may feel overwhelmed by so many decisions that they must make and choose not to use the application again.
